# Jupyter notebooks for kraken_flu
This folder contains notebooks that show the usage of the kraken_flu tool to build databases. 
The notebooks are currently used as reference for GSU/Sanger internal use. Some commands would not work on external systems as shown but should be easy to modify for this purpose.
